## Negotiate authentication

A negotiated, single sign on type of authentication that is the Windows implementation of [Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/windows-remote-management-glossary). SPNEGO negotiation determines whether authentication is handled by Kerberos or NTLM. Kerberos is the preferred mechanism. Negotiate authentication on Windows-based systems is also called Windows Integrated Authentication.
